    "We worked with the Million Playlist Dataset (MPD). The decompressed MPD’s size is 33.54 GB. The dataset consists of 1000 splits, each split contains 1000 playlists. Each playlist is a dictionary, which contains N ‘sub-dictionaries’ (N is the number of tracks in the playlist). Each ‘sub-dictionary’ contains detailed information on each track, with each piece of information being a key-value pair. \n",

    "To parse the dataset into a more structured format and to query more efficiently, we built a relational database by SQLite3 in Python. The schema of the database is shown in the figure below. The database was organized to three relational tables, storing information of playlists’ properties (`playlist_info`), tracks’ properties (`track_info`) and playlist-track information (`playlist`), respectively. Since we focused on the playlists here, the playlist’s ID (pid) is used as primary key in our the database (Fig. 1). To retrieve and query data from the database, SQL commands were used."
